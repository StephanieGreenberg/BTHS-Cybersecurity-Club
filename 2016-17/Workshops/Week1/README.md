# Intro to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is now one of the most fastest growing fields in the world. 
As we depend more and more on technology and the internet the amount of cybercrimes continue to increase.
This means we also need to do a better job of protecting ourselves. 
Every minute new insecure applications and services and these vulnerabilities are being exploited and sensitive information is being stolen as well as machines being compromised.
The best way to learn how to protect applications and information is to understand the offensive approach of an attacker.
By understanding these vulnerabilities, we can build better solutions for protecting ourselves.

The goal of these workshops in cybersecurity are to introduce beginners with little to no experience to basic concepts.
Participants will utilize this knowledge and apply it in high school and global cybersecurity competitions such as Capture the Flag.

During the first half of the year students will explore topics such as digital forensics, cryptography, web security, reverse engineering, networking, and much more.
The second half of the year students will actively participate in cybersecurity competitions such as picoCTF, HSCTF, CTCTF, and more.

The topics covered each week will be briefly summarized here on GitHub in case anyone misses a week or other people out there on the internet are looking for a resource.
Any tools or resources mentioned in or out of the workshops will also be included here, as well as any important links.

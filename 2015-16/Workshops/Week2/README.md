#Week 2: Virtual Machines and Linux

You can find this weeks presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15B-QUuf6CjwKjWJIWiXk46wcXsKYmvMeDM2hWBdriWk/edit?pli=1#slide=id.gcb84b61d4_0_116)
###Operating Systems
1. Windows
2. Mac
3. Linux

###Desktop vs. Server
* Desktop
  - User friendly (GUI, see below)
  - Comes with applications and software that you do need, along with additional software that is not crucial to your machine's function (iMovie on Mac, for example)
  - Can be used for any purpose
  - Portability
  - Modularity
* Server
  - Always on
  - Accessibly over the internet or a private network
  - No GUI
  - comes with ONLY the software that you need for BASIC functionality
  - usually configured for a specific purpose

###Linux vs. Windows Servers
Linux acts a much more convinient service; while windows serves require restarts for updates and to modify programs (installing/uninstalling), Linux rarely requires restarts.  Linux also offers greater stability and security, and is free!

###Virtual Machines
* Flexibility 
  - Hosted on remote servers, running in a window on your screen; allows you to experiment with different operating systems.
* Safety
  - Great for cyber security excercises, acts kinda like insurance; if you get a virus on a VM, it's not problem, and doesn't affect your actual machine
* Cross OS interaction
  - Can use different operating systems; allows you to use software only available to certain OS

###LUI vs. GUI: User Interfaces
A user interface is where humans and machines interact.
* GUI - Graphical User Interface
  - The software you use on a daily basis is a GUI.  When you interact with your computer's desktop, you click buttons to launch applications.  A GUI is visual, and is generally easier to understand than a LUI. 
* LUI - Line User Interface
  - Also known as a CLI, a command user interface, this user interface allows users to communicate with the machine through text.  Using your linux terminal or windows command prompt and using the commands listed below, you can launch applications, view and modify files, and more.

### The Command Line
Two different types- one of those internal rivalry debate things amongst programmers
* Bash - Bourn Again SHell
  - Most commonly supported
  - Scripting support, closely follows POSIX standards
* Z Shell (zsh)
  - Less common
  - Better tab completion, command corrections, less strict with POSIX

###Basic Linux Terminal Commands
* ```man``` - displays "manual", can be used with any other command to display definition/function
* ```mkdir``` - creates a directory
* ```ls``` - lists all the files ```(-a/l/r)```
* ```cd``` - change working directory
* ```pwd``` - print working directory
* ```mkdir``` - create a directory
* ```cp``` - copy a file or directory ```(-R)```
* ```mv``` - move a file or directory ``` (-R)```
* ```rm``` - delete a file or directory ```(-R/f)```
* ```clear``` - clears your terminal window of past commands

##### Wildcard Operator
The ```*``` operator can be used in many way:
* 

### Sudo and Root
sudo make me a sandwich

# Networking

This week's presentation is available [here](https://goo.gl/phIJAa).

### What is a network?

A network is just a bunch of computers that are connected so that they are able to communicate with each other.

##### Local Area Network (LAN)

A LAN is a group of computers that are connected close to each other (usually in the same room or building).

For example, you might think of school computers or a LoL LAN party:

##### The Internet

The largest network of computers in the world, now a crucial element of our daily lives.

### The Basics

Just like your house, computers also have an address that help us locate them. We call it the Internet Protocol Address or simple IP address. You can find out information about your network configuration, including your IP address, by entering `ipconfig` on windows or `ifconfig` on any unix/linux machine.

##### IPv4 vs IPv6

IPv4 is version 4 of the Internet Protocol while v6 is version 6. Most people are familiar with IPv4 addresses. They look like this: `167.206.10.237`

IPv6 addresses look like this: `2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652`

The main reason IPv6 exists is because IPv4 can only represent a relatively small number of addresses (2<sup>32</sup> = 4.3 Billion). In fact, we've already run out of addresses but a lot of them are unused and are being recycled. IPv6 can hold up to 340 Undecillion (2<sup>128</sup>) addresses. So it's safe to say we won't be running out anytime soon.

##### Domain Name

Domain names are basically nicknames for IP addresses. It makes things easier for humans because instead of remembering and typing `167.206.10.237` we can just type `google.com`.

### Domain Name Server (DNS)

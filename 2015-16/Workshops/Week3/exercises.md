Here are some simple exercises to help you get more comfortable with the command line:

We will start out with some easy stuff and slowly try more advanced things.

1) list all the the files in your home directory, ~, including the hidden files.
2) create a text file named easy.txt that says "Bash and vim are easy." (Don't forget to save and quit)
3) print the contents of that file to the console
4) make a copy of that text file and call it 2ez.txt
5) open the new copy you have made and copy the line you originally wrote and paste it 9 times. You should now have 10 lines.
6) download the file jabberwocky.txt from the week3 folder in this github
7) use grep to find the lines of jabberwocky.txt that have a 4 letter word
8) use the command you wrote to print the last objective and write it to a new file called icangrep.txt using I/O redirection

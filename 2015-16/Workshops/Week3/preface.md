# Linux Week 2

**[Click here to sign in for today's meeting][6].**

This week we will spend some more time becoming familiar with Linux and many of the most powerful tools that it has.
If you are bring in your laptop please make sure that you have either [VMware Fusion or Workstation][2] as well as either an [Ubuntu][3] or [Kali][4] Linux iso.
If you are unable to set up the vm yourself don't worry. We can help you during the workshop.
If you are not bringing in your laptop please download and install Babun on the computer you are sitting at until credentials to the server are distributed.

This week we will be covering how to [edit text files][5] and some helpful tools that let us do some pretty cool things with text.
We will also discuss standard input/output and [I/O redirection][1] and a few web tools.

We will post a few exercises here for you guys to try and help you get more comfortable with the command line.

# File Forensics

<!-- someone put sign in form pls -->
This week we will dive into the world of files. 
By now, everyone should either have access to the [server](http://128.238.66.241:57575) or bring in their laptop.
This week will be very interactive so don't forget to bring your laptop and have a VM set up.
If you do not have credentials to the server please let one of the executives know and we will try to help you asap.

We will be covering file signature analysis, steganography, and more.
Exercises will be available on this github as well.

Be there or be square!

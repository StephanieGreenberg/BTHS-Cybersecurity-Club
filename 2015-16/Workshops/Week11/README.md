# DWVA

Please sign in for this weeks club [here](bit.ly/bthscyber)

This week we will be experimenting with DVWA which will be hosted from our server [here](http://128.238.66.241).

[DVWA](https://github.com/RandomStorm/DVWA), stands for Damn Vulnerable Web App, is a controlled environment where anyone can explore and practice attacking a vulnerable web application on the front end as well as back end. Feel free to download and run it yourself locally on your computer. 

> Warning: It would be wise to run it in a virtual machine in order to avoid any outsiders from attacking your host computer. If you do run it directly on your host OS, make sure to close the port from external connections.

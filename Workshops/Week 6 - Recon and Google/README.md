#Recon and Google
You can find this week's presentation [here][1].  If you're not a pro internet stalker by the end of it, you didn't read through well enough :)

##Recon?
Reconnaissance is the act of gathering intelligence about people, systems, networks, etc.  It's often used in the preliminary stages of a hack, and can be active or passive.  Active recon can include OS scans, while passive recon can include sniffing regular host traffic in order to learn more about a user and what they do online, for example.

##Digital Traces
Google is all-seeing.  You leave digital traces of yourself everywhere, like:

1. Sites you visit
  - cookies, not the chocolatey kind
  - A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while the user is browsing it.  It stores information like login/credentials, and can keep track of how you interact with the site for analytical purposes.
2. Things you buy
  - amazon knows about those sus things you bought; how else does it send you emails and recommends products similar to the ones you were browsing on their site?
  - cookies come into play here as well
3. Things you like/post
  - do you know how to use facebook's privacy settings? do you know they exist?
4. GPS location
  - google maps knows where you live, where you travel to on a daily basis, etc, and can run in the background if you leave the app open.
5. Things you search
  - do you know how to clear history? delete cookies?
6. Whois
  - Check it out [here][2]

##Metadata
Metadata is data that describes other data, including an author, data/time a file wass created,  where it was created, etc.
1. It's lurking in photos
  - Check out this [site][3]
  
##All-seeing Google?
1. where you go, how often, and for how long (physically and digitally)
2. what you like or are curious/interested in
3. who you communicate with
4. webcrawlers and old versions of sites
5. image/news/video database
6. hella metadata

#How to Google
Take advantage of the all-seeing machine
###Basics
You prob know all of these already:
- Calculator
- Reverse image search
- unit conversions
- language translations
- boolean operators (AND/OR)
- definitions
- [url shortener][4]
- trends
- songs
- heads or tails

###Advanced
- search for results from specific plates with
  - ```intitle: ```
  - ```inurl: ```
- wildcard ```*```
- find exact words with quotes ```""```
- minus sign ```-``` to exclude certain results
- search for specific file types with ```filetype:```
- search ranges
  - ```2002...2013```
- cached or offline sites
- gooogle maps time travel
- find exact match with ```allintext:```
- find out your public ip
- google translate proxy

##Look everywhere
Don't neglect social medias!
- Facebook/Twitter/Tumblr
- 4Chan/Reddit
- Github/Linkedin
- Forums
- all the things

Things might not always be "deleted" the way you think.  For example, you can see past commits on Github with only a few clicks.

#Social Engineering
Human hacking; most systems are not compromised because of computers but rather people themselves
- impersonating someone
- appealing to emotions and desires
- tailgating

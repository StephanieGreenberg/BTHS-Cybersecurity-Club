## What is Web Security?

Web Security involves protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks.

## Basics of Web 

**HTML:** HyperText Markup Language - used to render pages on browsers.

**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheet - language / easier way of styling web pages. Very flexible and convenient.

**JavaScript:** A client side programming language used to make web pages interactive or dynamic.

**PHP:** Personal Home Page - Scripting language primarily used for server side operations.

**Databases:** a structured set of data held in a computer that is accessible in various ways.

**SQL:** Structured Query Language - Used to interact with a database. Request, input, or delete information. Simple and easy to understand.

**SQL Injection:** When user input is not validated or sanitized attackers can get into the query string and manipulate it. Attackers can get information and add, delete ,or alter data.

**XSS:** Cross Site Scripting - Injecting unauthorized code into a website
  
  Reflected XSS: Not persistent, immediate input only affects single client
  
  Stored XSS: Persistent, affects all other users on the site
  
  DOM-based XSS: Executed as a result of modifying DOM environment
  
**Brute Force:** A trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data like passwords through exhaustive effort rather than intellectual strategies.
The most common and easy to understand example is the dictionary attack. The attacker uses a password dictionary that contains millions of words. Then, the attacker tries them one by one to authenticate. If the dictionary contains the correct password, the attacker will succeed.

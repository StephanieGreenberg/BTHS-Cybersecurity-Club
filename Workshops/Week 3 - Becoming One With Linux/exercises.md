#Exercises
Here are some simple exercises to help you get more comfortable with the command line:

We will start out with some easy stuff and slowly try more advanced things.

1. List all the the files in your home directory, ```~```, including the hidden files.
2. Create a text file named ```easy.txt``` that says "Bash and vim are easy." (Don't forget to save and quit).
3. Print the contents of that file to the console.
4. Make a copy of that text file and call it ```2ez.txt```.
5. Open the new copy you have made and copy the line you originally wrote and paste it 9 times. You should now have 10 lines.
6. Download the file ```jabberwocky.txt``` from the week3 folder in this github.
7. Use ```grep``` to find the lines of ```jabberwocky.txt``` that have a 4 letter word.
8. Use the command you wrote to print the last objective and write it to a new file called ```icangrep.txt``` using I/O redirection.

#What is it?
Human hacking - most systems are not compromised because of computers but rather people themselves.
- a type of hacking that relies not on coding but on human interaction
- using psychology to appeal to emotions and desires and get people to give up information

#Examples
- pretending to be a delivery person
- sending an email to someone pretending to be their friend
- finding out a person's weaknesses and using them against them
